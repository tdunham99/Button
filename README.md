Pressing one button does nothing; pressing two buttons at the same time turns on the LED

1. Connect button to Pin 6
2. Connect second button to Pin 5
3. Connect LED to pin 22
4. Make sure to add GPIO.cleanup() at the end of file; NOT at the end of the method

Reflection:
For some reason, the button would always wobble into place and the program would work a percentage of the time. Turns out that for every component that belongs in the breadboard, they must fit snug into the hole.
